Word Guess Game

## Status
Game is not currently working, but I think I've pseudocoded most of what I'll need. I'm nodding off and need to rest, so after a doctor's appointment in the morning I have the rest of the day to finish this all.

It feels a little like I'm falling behind but I feel hopeful since I have this whole weekend to work and catch up and my time management with regards to my commute is improving.

## Tricks Used
For loops, Math.random, document.onkeyup, and eventually changing spans to string values using arrays.
