Word Guess Game

## Status
Status update: you can now win or lose the game! Most of what remains is changing the html, making the reset happen, and beautifying it. Currently working on dynamic html changes.

Game is unfinished but game.js is, at least, almost done. I have fallen behind in class due to time management struggles and personal problems that struck up over the weekend, but the personal problems have been resolved and I've reorganized my schedule a little to fix the time management. Rather than head to the Sounder at 3p to try and "beat traffic" (ha!) I will be staying in the classroom until 5:30p so that I can work on my homework with resources like TAs and classmates readily available so I can catch up, stay up, and hopefully get ahead. Thanks for bearing with me.

## Tricks Used
For loops, Math.random, document.onkeyup, .getElementById, and eventually changing spans to string values using arrays.

## Challenges
A lot of the challenges I faced had me researching, creating, and scrapping different ways of trying things. For example, commented at the bottom of game.js is a function I made that I ended up scrapping because I ended up not being able to wrap my head around how I was even going to use it once it was done. I kept it around just in case, but it's a prime example of how I get curious about how to do something and then overcomplicate it for where I'm at in my learning. 8)
